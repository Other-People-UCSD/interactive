The Choose-Your-Own-Adventure JavaScript file will get the data JSON file by finding the URL of this file determined by the post title entered onto the page. Then buttons with a function to go to a specified passage can be clicked on to read the JSON file's data and replace the `<div id='cyoa'></div>`'s innerHTML. This currently supports two formats of JSON where one is plain-text entries with help from additional fields, while the other is valid HTML that is added to the innerHTML in a straightforward manner.
